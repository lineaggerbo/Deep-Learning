\chapter{Project}

The project for this reading course is chosen to be carried out using the deep
learning framework Caffe. The framework is well known in the deep learning
community. It is a rather simple way to obtain a classification convolutional
neural network in a very short time, which is the reason why it has been chosen.

The idea of this project is to try out some different neural networks with
different values for its hyperparameters and to see which values will obtain
the highest accuracy when training and testing on the CIFAR-10 image data set.

The convolutional network used for inspiration is the one introduced in "Alex's
CIFAR-10 tutorial, Caffe
style"\footnote{http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/gathered/examples/cifar10.html}
provided by the team behind Caffe. This convolutional network and the changes
made to it will be described later on in this chapter along with the
architecture and the different types of layers.
