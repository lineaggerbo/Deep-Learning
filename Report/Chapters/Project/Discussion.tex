\label{sec:discussion}

We have experimented with different configurations in the Caffe framework for
convolutional neural networks as explained in \autoref{sec:networks}. These
experiments resulted in three different networks: The initial CNN, The CNN with
additional convolution layer and The customized AlexNet. Our hypothesis for our
networks were to improve the performance by adding layers and mimicking
a the architecture of a well known CNN. Despite our effort to improve our
networks - based on literature from cs231n \cite{cs231n}, the AlexNet
article\cite{AlexNet} and the article by Zeiler and Fergus \cite{ZeilerFergus} -
the accuracy for the initial CNN on 0.7227 using 4000 iterations is the best result that we could obtain in the experiments.


One of the reasons why our customized AlexNet did not perform as intented could
be our choise of lowering the different parameters in order to be able to use
the AlexNet architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
