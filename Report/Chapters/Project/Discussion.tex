\label{sec:discussion}

We have experimented with different configurations in the Caffe framework for convolutional neural
networks as explained in \autoref{sec:networks}.  
 
 
The accuracy for the initial CNN is the best result that we could obtain despite
our effort to improve the network based on literature from cs231n \cite{cs231n},
the AlexNet article\cite{AlexNet} and the article by Zeiler and Fergus
\cite{ZeilerFergus}.


- Sammenlign med CIFAR fra exercise 1 Q1, ``Train a network'' 
- Vores hypoteser holder ikke.
