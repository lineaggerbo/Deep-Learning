\section{Networks} % (fold)
\label{sec:networks}

The network from the tutorial described earlier in this report is reffered to
as the initial network. The orther networks which are tried out in this
project is based on this network with some changes in the architecture. All
networks are described in this section.

\subsection{The initial network} % (fold)
\label{sub:the_initial_network}

The initial network is a six layer network. The network consists of three
convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. The layers are as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The first layer consists of a convolution with a kernel size of five, a
	stride of one and a padding of two. The activation function is ReLU. It
	also consists of max pooling with a kernel size of three and a stride of two.
	\item The second layer consists of the same three parts with the same values
	of strides and kernel sizes.
	\item The third layer also consists of three parts. The convolutional part
	and the ReLU is the same as in the earlier layers. But instead of using max
	pooling, average pooling is used.
	\item The fourth layer is a normal fully connected layer.
	\item The fifth layer is also a normal fully connected layer.
	\item The sixth layer is a fully coonected Softmax layer.
\end{enumerate}
For a detailed description of each type of layer see
\autoref{sec:convolutional_network_architecture}.

\label{sub:alexNet}

We have tried to mimic the architecture of AlexNet\cite{AlexNet} in order to
test its performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
