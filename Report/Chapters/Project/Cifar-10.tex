\section{CIFAR-10} % (fold)
\label{sec:cifar_10}

The dataset used to train and test the convolutional network on in this project is chosen to be the CIFAR-10 dataset. This dataset is a labeled subset of the much larger tiny image dataset (which contains 80 million tiny images). The collecting has been done by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 images spread among 10 classes. The classes are the following: airplane, automobile, bird, car, deer, dog, frog,, horse, ship and truck. The images are of size 32$\times$32 pixels and are colour images.

The dataset is split into a training part and a test part. The training part of the dataset is 50,000 images split into five training batches which contains 10,000 random images each. The test part of the dataset contains exactly 1,000 images from each class which results in a total number of 10,000 images.

The dataset can be downloaded from Alex Krizhevsky's home page\footnote{https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html}.
