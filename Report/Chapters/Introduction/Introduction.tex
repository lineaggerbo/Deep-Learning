\chapter{Introduction}

This report is written throughout the reading course 'Deep Learning' at Aarhus
University Department of Engineering. The reading course is based on parts of
the teaching resources from the CS231n 'Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual
Recognition' course at Stanford University taught by Andrej
Karpathy\cite{cs231n}.

The report consists of three parts. The first two parts are the group's solutions for two given exercises in the reading course - Exercise 1 and Exercise 2. The exercises are solved in iPython and are a part of the CS231n course as well.

The third part is a project which is chosen by the group. The project chosen is to use the deep learning framework Caffe to classify images from the image database CIFAR-10.
