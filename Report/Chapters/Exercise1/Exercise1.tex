\section{Neural Network layers} % (fold)
\label{sec:Neural_Networ_layers}





Q1: Will walk you through implementing a two-layer neural network on CIFAR-10.
This part of the exercise also has you implementing 1st and 2nd order methods for parameter updates

Q2: A modular Neural Network implementation. You will implement the forward and
backward passes of an affine layer and a ReLU layer


Exercise 1 can be found in the Appendix.
