\chapter{Exercise 1}

\section{Neural Network layers} % (fold)
\label{sec:Neural_Networ_layers}


The first exercise is two folded. The first part is a walkthrough of
implementing a two-layer neural network and using it on the CIFAR-10 dataset. In
order for the network to work we implemented the 1st and 2nd order methods for
parameter updates to the weights and biases. 

The second part of the exercise requires implementation of three modules: The
forward and backward passes of an affine layer and a Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU) layer.  

The solution to exercise 1 can be found in the Appendix.
